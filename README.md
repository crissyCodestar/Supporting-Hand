# SupportingHand

A search engine powered by Donors Choose API. Using Google Map to display the users search results as well as saving registered searches in users localhost. Links are provided to the donors url so users can donate to the school of their choosing

# Getting Started

You will only need Node.js installed on your environmemnt as well as [React JS](https://reactjs.org/), npm or Yarn to get a copy of this project up and running on you local machine for development and testing. I am also using [Grommet.io](http://grommet.io) for UI.

## Yarn or npm

In your terminal, if you do not have Node.js installed please go to [Node.js for assistance](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) & don't forget [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), whichever you prefer.

```
$ yarn -v
1.5.1


$ npm -v
5.6.0
```

## React JS

This App is built on the [React Js](https://reactjs.org) framework so, yea it is totally needed.

```
$ npm info react version
16.3.2
```
